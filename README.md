# Parking_Space_Detection
This repository contains a computer vision project aimed at detecting available parking spaces in real-time using video streams or images. The project leverages advanced techniques like object detection and image processing to identify and classify parking spaces as occupied or vacant.

# Main Frame:
* Python, OpenCV

# How to use:
* Parking_Space_Picker: This file is used to select parking spaces by drawing square regions on an image. It allows you to manually select areas where parking spaces are located.

* Tune_Demo: This file loads the saved pickle file that contains the parking space positions and applies it to a video. It detects and highlights the parking spaces in the video based on the selected regions.

* Main: This is the main file to run the product. It processes the video, detects parking space occupancy, and provides the final output with visual markers.
